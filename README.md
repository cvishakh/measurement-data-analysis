#Task1: Investigated signal processing approaches with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The primary goal was to gain insight into the underlying features of the Fourier transform and use these notions to analyze a vibrationmeasurement on a crane boom.

#Task2: Solving differential equations with the Symbolic Math Toolbox using the example of a bending beam
